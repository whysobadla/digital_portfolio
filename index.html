    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Jun Hong, a recent diploma graduate in Cybersecurity and digital forensics, having also completed my
      National Service. With a strong foundation in secure workflow design and hands‑on experience in troubleshooting
      complex network issues, I am eager to begin my career in a full‑time role.

      My training has equipped me with skills in audit‑friendly system design, scenario‑driven diagnostics, and clear
      documentation for stakeholders. I enjoy bridging technical depth with practical solutions, ensuring systems are
      not only secure but also maintainable and user‑friendly.

      I am now seeking opportunities where I can contribute my expertise in InfoSecurity strategy and forensic workflow
      architecture, while continuing to grow as a professional in a dynamic, forward‑thinking organization.

      <h3>Automated Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>Developed and implemented PowerShell, and Python Scripting as a solution to automate network troubleshooting
        workflows. It automated all manual efforts related to diagnostic activities like collecting logs, checking
        connectivity, and detecting error patterns by approximately 70% which was previously being done manually. This
        reduced the time consumed in responding to an incident thus making the process consistent, eliminating human
        errors providing audit-ready outputs for review by stakeholders.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="image copy 2.png" alt="Connectivity Case Study" class="card-img">
      <h3>Connectivity Case Study</h3>
      <p>Did a deep check of ISP routing and link problems using traceroute and pathping. Found slow spots and setup
        errors on both local and international jumps, then wrote down the details in a clear report for sending to
        service providers. This case study boosted insight into network performance helped speed up fixing outages and
        gave stakeholders clear proof ready for audits to make choices.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="image copy.png" alt="Audit Documentation Framework" class="card-img">
      <h3>Audit Documentation Framework</h3>
      <p>Created and put into place a structured reporting plan that made documents ready for audits with proof that
        can be repeated. Made the way technical findings are collected and shown standard, making sure to follow both
        group and rules needs. This setup cut review times from two weeks to just ten hours, better stakeholder
        confidence on reports they are getting as accurate, and seamless collaboration between technical teams and
        auditors.</p>
